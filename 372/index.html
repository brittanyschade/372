        <p>For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down. In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it. I wrote you 365 letters. I don't sit in while you're running it down. Hey girl, I brought home a few bottles of wine since I know you needed more corks for that pinterest project. I love being Canadian. I think growing up in Canada gives you a world perspective that I certainly enjoy. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down.</p>
